            <p>Design Overview: <br>
                The "NEON" logo is a minimalist and modern design that plays with bold typography and negative space to create a striking visual identity. The design is clean and straightforward, embodying the sleekness and clarity often associated with the term "neon."
                <br><br>
                Visual Elements: <br>
                <br>
                Typography: <br>The use of a sans-serif font with bold, clean lines gives the logo a contemporary and futuristic feel. The design of the "O" with a distinct cut-out section adds a unique character to the logo, making it instantly recognizable.
                <br><br>
                Color Scheme: <br>The logo is predominantly black, which contrasts sharply against a white background. This monochromatic color scheme emphasizes simplicity and sophistication, aligning with modern design trends.
                <br><br>
                Negative Space: <br>The clever use of negative space, particularly in the "O" and the elongated "E," creates a sense of movement and dynamism, reflecting the energy associated with neon lights.
                <br><br>
                Purpose: <br>
                This logo is designed to represent a brand that values modernity, simplicity, and a strong visual impact. The "NEON" logo is versatile and adaptable, making it suitable for various applications, from digital platforms to physical signage.</p>
