                <br>
                Color Scheme: <br>The dark palette, punctuated by subtle reds and blues, creates a sense of suspense and anticipation. The glowing outlines add a futuristic, almost ethereal quality to the design.
                <br><br>
                Character Design: <br>The silhouette of the protagonist is backlit, with just enough detail to convey his presence without revealing too much, enhancing the intrigue.

                Typography: <br> The words "PREPARE" and "AWAKEN" flank the top corners, setting the tone for the player’s journey. The central title "Operation Asura" is bold and clean, conveying the game's mission-driven theme.
                <br><br>
